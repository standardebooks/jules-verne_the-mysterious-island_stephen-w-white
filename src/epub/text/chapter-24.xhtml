			</header>
			<p>On the 29th of October the canoe was finished. Pencroff had kept his word, and had built, in five days, a sort of bark shell, stiffened with flexible <i>crejimba</i> rods. A seat at either end, another midway to keep it open, a gunwale for the tholepins of a pair of oars, and a paddle to steer with, completed this canoe, which was twelve feet in length, and did not weigh 200 pounds.</p>
			<p>“Hurrah!” cried the sailor, quite ready to applaud his own success. “With this we can make the tour of⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Of the world?” suggested Spilett.</p>
			<p>“No, but of the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast in the bow, with a sail which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith will make someday, and away we’ll go! But now let us try our new ship, for we must see if it will carry all of us.”</p>
			<p>The experiment was made. Pencroff, by a stroke of the paddle, brought the canoe close to the shore by a narrow passage between the rocks, and he was confident that they could at once make a trial trip of the craft by following the bank as far as the lower point where the rocks ended.</p>
			<p>As they were stepping in, Neb cried:⁠—</p>
			<p>“But your boat leaks, Pencroff.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, that’s nothing, Neb,” answered the sailor. “The wood has to drink! But in two days it will not show, and there will be as little water in our canoe as in the stomach of a drunkard! Come, get in!”</p>
			<p>They all embarked, and Pencroff pushed off. The weather was splendid, the sea was as calm as a lake, and the canoe could venture upon it with as much security as upon the tranquil current of the Mercy.</p>
			<p>Neb and Herbert took the oars, and Pencroff sat in the stern with the paddle as steersman.</p>
			<p>The sailor crossed the channel, and rounded the southern point of the islet. A gentle breeze was wafted from the south. There were no billows, but the canoe rose and fell with the long undulations of the sea, and they rowed out half a mile from the coast so as to get a view of the outline of Mount Franklin. Then, putting about, Pencroff returned towards the mouth of the river, and followed along the rounded shore which hid the low marshy ground of Tadorn’s Fens. The point, made longer by the bend of the coast, was three miles from the Mercy, and the colonists resolved to go past it far enough to obtain a hasty glance at the coast as far as Claw Cape.</p>
			<p>The canoe followed along the shore, keeping off some two cables length so as to avoid the line of rocks beginning to be covered by the tide. The cliff, beginning at the mouth of the river, lowered as it approached the promontory. It was a savage-looking, unevenly-arranged heap of granite blocks, very different from the curtain of Prospect Plateau. There was not a trace of vegetation on this sharp point, which projected two miles beyond the forest, like a giant’s arm, thrust out from a green sleeve.</p>
			<p>The canoe sped easily along. Spilett sketched the outline of the coast in his notebook, and Neb, Pencroff, and Herbert discussed the features of their new domain; and as they moved southward the two Mandible Capes seemed to shut together and enclose Union Bay. As to Smith, he regarded everything in silence, and from his distrustful expression it seemed as if he was observing some suspicious land.</p>
			<p>The canoe had reached the end of the point and was about doubling it, when Herbert rose, and pointing out a black object, said:⁠—</p>
			<p>“What is that down there on the sand?”</p>
			<p>Everyone looked in the direction indicated.</p>
			<p>“There is something there, indeed,” said the reporter. “It looks like a wreck half buried in the sand.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I see what it is!” cried Pencroff.</p>
			<p>“What?” asked Neb.</p>
			<p>“Barrels! they are barrels, and maybe they are full!”</p>
			<p>“To shore, Pencroff!” said Smith.</p>
			<p>And with a few strokes the canoe was driven into a little cove, and the party went up the beach.</p>
			<p>Pencroff was not mistaken. There were two barrels half buried in the sand; but firmly fastened to them was a large box, which, borne up by them, had been floated on to the shore.</p>
			<p>“Has there been a shipwreck here?” asked Herbert.</p>
			<p>“Evidently,” answered Spilett.</p>
			<p>“But what is in this box?” exclaimed Pencroff, with a natural impatience. “What is in this box? It is closed, and we have nothing with which to raise the lid. However, with a stone⁠—”</p>
			<p>And the sailor picked up a heavy rock, and was about to break one of the sides, when the engineer, stopping him, said:⁠—</p>
			<p>“Cannot you moderate your impatience for about an hour, Pencroff?”</p>
			<p>“But, think, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith! Maybe there is everything we want in it!”</p>
			<p>“We will find out, Pencroff,” answered the engineer, “but do not break the box, as it will be useful. Let us transport it to Granite House, where we can readily open it without injuring it. It is all prepared for the voyage, and since it has floated here, it can float again to the river mouth.”</p>
			<p>“You are right, sir, and I am wrong,” answered the sailor, “but one is not always his own master!”</p>
			<p>The engineer’s advice was good. It was likely that the canoe could not carry the things probably enclosed in the box, since the latter was so heavy that it had to be buoyed up by two empty barrels. It was, therefore, better to tow it in this condition to the shore at the Granite House.</p>
			<p>And now the important question was, from whence came this jetsam? Smith and his companions searched the beach for several hundred paces, but there was nothing else to be seen. They scanned the sea, Herbert and Neb climbing up a high rock, but not a sail was visible on the horizon.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, there must have been a shipwreck, and perhaps this incident was connected with the incident of the bullet. Perhaps the strangers had landed upon another part of the island. Perhaps they were still there. But the natural conclusion of the colonists was that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, since the jetsam was evidently of European or American production.</p>
			<p>They all went back to the box, which measured five feet by three. It was made of oak, covered with thick leather, studded with copper nails. The two large barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded empty, were fastened to its sides by means of strong ropes, tied in what Pencroff recognized to be sailor’s knots. That it was uninjured seemed to be accounted for by the fact of its having been thrown upon the sand instead of the rocks. And it was evident that it had not been long either in the sea or upon the beach. It seemed probable, also, that the water had not penetrated, and that its contents would be found uninjured. It therefore looked as if this box must have been thrown overboard from a disabled ship making for the island. And, in the hope that it would reach the island, where they would find it later, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up.</p>
			<p>“We will tow this box to Granite House,” said the engineer, “and take an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the survivors of this supposed shipwreck, we will return them what is theirs. If we find no one⁠—”</p>
			<p>“We will keep the things ourselves!” cried the sailor. “But I wish I knew what is in it.”</p>
			<p>The sailor was already working at the prize, which would doubtless float at high water. One of the ropes which was fastened to the barrels was partly untwisted and served to fasten these latter to the canoe. Then, Neb and Pencroff dug out the sand with their oars, and soon the canoe, with the jetsam in tow, was rounding the promontory to which they gave the name of Jetsam Point. The box was so heavy that the barrels just sufficed to sustain it above the water; and Pencroff feared each moment that it would break loose and sink to the bottom. Fortunately his fears were groundless, and in an hour and a half the canoe touched the bank before Granite House.</p>
			<p>The boat and the prize were drawn upon the shore, and as the tide was beginning to fall, both soon rested on dry ground. Neb brought some tools so as to open the box without injury, and the colonists forthwith proceeded to examine its contents.</p>
			<p>Pencroff did not try to hide his anxiety. He began by unfastening the barrels, which would be useful in the future, then the fastenings were forced with pincers, and the cover taken off. A second envelope, of zinc, was enclosed within the case, in such a manner that its contents were impervious to moisture.</p>
			<p>“Oh!” cried Pencroff, “they must be preserves which are inside.”</p>
			<p>“I hope for something better than that,” answered the reporter.</p>
			<p>“If it should turn out that there was⁠—” muttered the sailor.</p>
			<p>“What?” asked Neb.</p>
			<p>“Nothing!”</p>
			<p>The zinc cover was split, lengthwise and turned back, and, little by little, many different objects were lifted out on the sand. At each new discovery Pencroff cheered, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced. There were books which made the lad crazy with pleasure, and cooking implements which Neb covered with kisses.</p>
			<p>In truth the colonists had reason to be satisfied, as the following inventory, copied from Spilett’s notebook, will show:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote class="list">
				<p><i>Tools.</i>⁠—3 pocketknives, with several blades, 2 wood-chopper’s hatchets, 2 carpenter’s hatchets, 3 planes, 1 adzes, 1 axe, 6 cold chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.</p>
				<p><i>Arms.</i>⁠—2 flintlock guns, 2 percussion guns, 2 central-fire carbines; 5 cutlasses, 4 boarding sabres, 2 barrels of powder, holding 15 pounds each, 12 boxes of caps.</p>
				<p><i>Instruments.</i>⁠—1 sextant, 1 opera-glass, 1 spyglass, 1 box compass, 1 pocket compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus, together with glasses, chemicals, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
				<p><i>Clothing.</i>⁠—2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, though evidently a vegetable substance; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.</p>
				<p><i>Utensils.</i>⁠—1 Iron pot, 6 tinned copper stewpans, 3 iron plates, 10 aluminium knives and forks, 2 kettles, 1 small portable stove, 5 table knives.</p>
				<p><i>Books.</i>⁠—1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of Polynesian languages, 1 dictionary of the natural sciences, 3 reams of blank paper, 2 blank books.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“Unquestionably,” said the reporter, after the inventory had been taken, “the owner of this box was a practical man! Tools, arms, instruments, clothing, utensils, books, nothing is wanting. One would say that he had made ready for a shipwreck beforehand!”</p>
			<p>“Nothing, indeed, is wanting,” murmured Smith, thoughtfully.</p>
			<p>“And it is a sure thing,” added Herbert, “that the ship that brought this box was not a Malay pirate!”</p>
			<p>“Unless its owner had been taken prisoner,” said Pencroff.</p>
			<p>“That is not likely,” answered the reporter. “It is more probable that an American or European ship has been driven to this neighborhood, and that the passengers, wishing to save what was, at least, necessary, have prepared this box and have thrown it overboard.”</p>
			<p>“And do you think so, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith?” asked Herbert.</p>
			<p>“Yes, my boy,” answered the engineer, “that might have been the case. It is possible, that, anticipating a ship wreck, this chest has been prepared, so that it might be found again on the coast⁠—”</p>
			<p>“But the photographic apparatus!” observed the sailor incredulously.</p>
			<p>“As to that,” answered the engineer, “I do not see its use; what we, as well as any other ship wrecked person, would have valued more, would have been a greater assortment of clothing and more ammunition!”</p>
			<p>“But have none of these things any mark by which we can tell where they came from?” asked Spilett.</p>
			<p>They looked to see. Each article was examined attentively, but, contrary to custom, neither books, instruments, nor arms had any name or mark; nevertheless, they were in perfect order, and seemed never to have been used. So also with the tools and utensils; everything was new, and this went to prove that the things had not been hastily thrown together in the box, but that their selection had been made thoughtfully and with care. This, also, was evident from the zinc case which had kept everything watertight, and which could not have been soldered in a moment.</p>
			<p>The two dictionaries and the Bible were in English, and the latter showed that it had been often read. The Atlas was a splendid work, containing maps of every part of the world, and many charts laid out on Mercator’s projection. The nomenclature in this book was in French, but neither in it, nor in any of the others, did the name of the editor or publisher appear.</p>
			<p>The colonists, therefore, were unable to even conjecture the nationality of the ship that had so recently passed near them. But no matter where it came from, this box enriched the party on Lincoln Island. Until now, in transforming the products of nature, they had created everything for themselves, and had succeeded by their own intelligence. Did it not now seem as if Providence had intended to reward them by placing these divers products of human industry in their hands? Therefore, with one accord, they all rendered thanks to Heaven.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, Pencroff was not entirely satisfied. It appeared that the box did not contain something to which he attached an immense importance, and as its contents lessened, his cheers had become less hearty, and when the inventory was closed, he murmured:⁠—</p>
			<p>“That’s all very fine, but you see there is nothing for me here!”</p>
			<p>“Why, what did you expect, Pencroff?” exclaimed Neb.</p>
			<p>“A half pound of tobacco,” answered the sailor, “and then I would have been perfectly happy!”</p>
			<p>The discovery of this jetsam made the thorough exploration of the island more necessary than ever. It was, therefore, agreed that they should set out early the next morning, proceeding to the western coast via the Mercy. If anyone had been shipwrecked on that part of the island, they were doubtless without resources, and help must be given them at once.</p>
			<p>During the day the contents of the box were carried to Granite House and arranged in order in the great hall. And that evening⁠—the 29th of October⁠—Herbert before retiring asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith to read some passages from the Bible.</p>
			<p>“Gladly,” answered the engineer, taking the sacred book in his hands; when Pencroff checking him, said:⁠—</p>
			<p>“<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Smith, I am superstitious. Open the book at random and read the first verse which you meet with. We will see if it applies to our situation.”</p>
			<p>Smith smiled at the words of the sailor, but yielding to his wishes he opened the Bible where the marker lay between the leaves. Instantly his eye fell upon a red cross made with a crayon, opposite the 8th verse of the seventh chapter of <abbr>St.</abbr> Matthew.</p>
			<p>He read these words:⁠—</p>
			<p>“For everyone that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth.”</p>
