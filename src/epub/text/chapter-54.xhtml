			</header>
			<p>The next day, the 18th, was devoted to an exploration of the wooded shore lying between Reptile End and Fall River. The colonists were searching through the heart of the forest, whose width, bounded by the shores of the promontory, was from three to four miles. The trees, by their size and foliage, bore witness to the richness of the soil, more productive here than in any other portion of the island. It seemed as if a portion of the virgin forests of America or Central Africa had been transported here. It seemed, also, as if these superb trees found beneath the soil, moist on its surface, but heated below by volcanic fires, a warmth not belonging to a temperate climate. The principal trees, both in number and size, were the <i xml:lang="mi">kauris</i> and eucalypti.</p>
			<p>But the object of the colonists was not to admire these magnificent vegetables. They knew already that, in this respect, their island merited a first place in the Canaries, called, formerly, the Fortunate Isles. But, alas! their island no longer belonged to them alone; others had taken possession, wretches whom it was necessary to destroy to the last man.</p>
			<p>On the west coast they found no further traces of any kind.</p>
			<p>“This does not astonish me,” said Smith. “The convicts landed near Jetsam Point, and, after having crossed Tadorn’s Fens, they buried themselves in the forests of the Far West. They took nearly the same route which we have followed. That explains the traces we have seen in the woods. Arrived upon the shore, the convicts saw very clearly that it offered no convenient shelter, and it was then, on going towards the north, that they discovered the corral⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Where they may have returned,” said Pencroff.</p>
			<p>“I do not think so,” answered the engineer, “as they would judge that our searches would be in that direction. The corral is only a provisional and not a permanent retreat for them.”</p>
			<p>“I think so, too,” said the reporter, “and, further, that they have sought a hiding place among the spurs of Mount Franklin.”</p>
			<p>“Then let us push on to the corral!” cried Pencroff. “An end must be put to this thing, and we are only losing time here.”</p>
			<p>“No, my friend,” replied the engineer.</p>
			<p>“You forget that we are interested in determining whether the forests of the Far West do not shelter some habitation. Our exploration has a double end, Pencroff; to punish crime and to make a discovery.”</p>
			<p>“That is all very well, sir,” replied the sailor, “but I have an idea that we will not discover our friend unless he chooses!”</p>
			<p>Pencroff had expressed the opinion of the others as well as his own. It was, indeed, probable that the retreat of the unknown being was no less mysterious than his personality.</p>
			<p>This evening the wagon halted at the mouth of Fall River. The encampment was made in the usual way, with the customary precautions. Herbert had recovered his former strength by this march in the fresh salt air, and his place was no longer on the wagon, but at the head of the line.</p>
			<p>On the 19th, the colonists left the shore and followed up the left bank of Fall River. The route was already partially cleared, owing to the previous excursions made from the corral to the west coast. They reached a place six miles from Mount Franklin.</p>
			<p>The engineer’s project was to observe with great care all the valley through which flowed the river, and to work cautiously up to the corral. If they should find it occupied, they were to secure it by main force, but if it should be empty, it was to be used as the point from which the explorations of Mount Franklin would be made.</p>
			<p>The road was through a narrow valley, separating two of the most prominent spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees grew closely together on the banks of the river, but were more scattered on the upper slopes. The ground was very much broken, affording excellent opportunities for an ambush, so that it was necessary to advance with great caution. Top and Jup went ahead, exploring the thickets on either hand, but nothing indicated either the presence or nearness of the convicts, or that these banks had been recently visited.</p>
			<p>About five o’clock the wagon halted 600 paces from the enclosure, hidden by a curtain of tall trees.</p>
			<p>It was necessary to reconnoitre the place, in order to find out whether it was occupied, but to do this in the daytime was to run the risk of being shot; nevertheless Spilett wanted to make the experiment at once, and Pencroff, out of all patience, wanted to go with him. But Smith would not permit it.</p>
			<p>“No, my friends,” said he, “wait until nightfall. I will not allow one of you to expose yourselves in the daylight.”</p>
			<p>“But, sir,”⁠—urged the sailor, but little disposed to obey.</p>
			<p>“Pray do not go, Pencroff,” said the engineer.</p>
			<p>“All right,” said the sailor. But he gave vent to his anger by calling the convicts everything bad that he could think of.</p>
			<p>The colonists remained about the wagon, keeping a sharp lookout in the adjoining parts of the forest.</p>
			<p>Three hours passed in this manner. The wind fell, and absolute silence reigned over everything. The slightest sound⁠—the snapping of a twig, a step on the dry leaves⁠—could easily have been heard. But all was quiet. Top rested with his head between his paws, giving no sign of inquietude.</p>
			<p>By eight o’clock the evening was far enough advanced for the reconnoissance to be undertaken, and Spilett and Pencroff set off alone. Top and Jup remained behind with the others, as it was necessary that no bark or cry should give the alarm.</p>
			<p>“Do not do anything imprudently,” urged Smith. “Remember, you are not to take possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it is occupied or not.”</p>
			<p>“All right,” answered Pencroff.</p>
			<p>The two set out, advancing with the greatest caution. Under the trees, the darkness was such as to render objects, thirty or forty paces distant, invisible. Five minutes after having left the wagon they reached the edge of the opening, at the end of which rose the fence of the enclosure. Here they halted. Some little light still illuminated the glade. Thirty paces distant was the gate of the corral, which seemed to be closed. These thirty paces which it was necessary to cross constituted, to use a ballistic expression, the dangerous zone, as a shot from the palisade would certainly have killed anyone venturing himself within this space,</p>
			<p>Spilett and the sailor were not men to shirk danger, but they knew that any imprudence of theirs would injure their companions as well as themselves. If they were killed what would become of the others?</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, Pencroff was so excited in finding himself again close to the corral that he would have hurried forward had not the strong hand of Spilett detained him. “In a few minutes it will be dark,” whispered the reporter.</p>
			<p>Pencroff grasped his gun nervously, and waited unwillingly.</p>
			<p>Very soon the last rays of light disappeared. Mount Franklin loomed darkly against the western sky, and the night fell with the rapidity peculiar to these low latitudes. Now was the time.</p>
			<p>The reporter and Pencroff, ever since their arrival on the edge of the wood, had watched the corral. It seemed to be completely deserted. The upper edge of the palisade was in somewhat stronger relief than the surrounding shades, and nothing broke its outlines. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have posted one of their number as a guard.</p>
			<p>Spilett took the hand of his companion, and crept cautiously forward to the gate of the corral. Pencroff tried to push it open, but it was, as they had supposed, fastened. But the sailor discovered that the outer bars were not in place. They, therefore, concluded that the convicts were within, and had fastened the gate so that it could only be broken open.</p>
			<p>They listened. No sound broke the silence. The animals were doubtless sleeping in their sheds. Should they scale the fence? It was contrary to Smith’s instructions. They might be successful or they might fail. And, if there was now a chance of surprising the convicts, should they risk that chance in this way?</p>
			<p>The reporter thought not. He decided that it would be better to wait until they were all together before making the attempt. Two things were certain, that they could reach the fence unseen, and that the place seemed unguarded.</p>
			<p>Pencroff, probably, agreed to this, for he returned with the reporter to the wood, and a few minutes later Smith was informed of the situation.</p>
			<p>“Well,” said he after reflecting for a moment, “I don’t think that the convicts are here.”</p>
			<p>“We will find out when we have climbed in.” cried Pencroff.</p>
			<p>“To the corral, my friends.”</p>
			<p>“Shall we leave the wagon in the wood?” cried Neb.</p>
			<p>“No,” said Smith, “it may serve as a defense in case of need.”</p>
			<p>The wagon issued from the wood and rolled noiselessly over the ground. The darkness and the silence were profound. The colonists kept their guns in readiness to fire. Jup kept behind, at Pencroff’s order, and Neb held Top.</p>
			<p>Soon the dangerous zone was crossed, and the wagon was drawn up beside the fence. Neb stood at the head of the onagers to keep them quiet, and the others went to the gate to determine if it was barricaded on the inside.</p>
			<p>One of its doors was open!</p>
			<p>“What did you tell us?” exclaimed the engineer, turning to the sailor and Spilett.</p>
			<p>They were stupefied with amazement.</p>
			<p>“Upon my soul,” cried the sailor, “It was shut a minute ago!”</p>
			<p>The colonists hesitated. The convicts must have been in the corral when Pencroff and the reporter had made their reconnoissance; for the gate could only have been opened by them. Were they still there?</p>
			<p>At this moment, Herbert, who had ventured some steps within the inclosure, rushed back and seized Smith’s hand.</p>
			<p>“What have you seen?” asked the engineer.</p>
			<p>“A light!”</p>
			<p>“In the house?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
			<p>All went forward and saw a feeble ray of light trembling through the windows of the building.</p>
			<p>Smith determined what to do at once.</p>
			<p>“It is a fortunate chance, finding the convicts shut up in this house not expecting anything! They are ours! Come on!”</p>
			<p>The wagon was left under charge of Top and Jup, and the colonists glided into the enclosure. In a few moments they were before the closed door of the house.</p>
			<p>Smith, making a sign to his companions not to move, approached the window. He looked into the one room which formed the lower story of the building. On the table was a lighted lantern, Near by was Ayrton’s bed. On it was the body of a man.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, Smith uttered a stiffled exclamation.</p>
			<p>“Ayrton!” he cried.</p>
			<p>And, at once, the door was rather forced than opened, and all rushed into the chamber.</p>
			<p>Ayrton seemed to be sleeping. His face showed marks of long and cruel suffering. His wrists and ankles were much bruised.</p>
			<p>Smith leaned over him.</p>
			<p>“Ayrton!” cried the engineer, seizing in his arms this man found so unexpectedly.</p>
			<p>Ayrton opened his eyes, and looked first at Smith, then at the others.</p>
			<p>“You! Is it you?” he cried.</p>
			<p>“Ayrton! Ayrton!” repeated the engineer.</p>
			<p>“Where am I?”</p>
			<p>“In the corral.”</p>
			<p>“Am I alone?”</p>
			<p>“Yes.”</p>
			<p>“Then they will come here!” cried Ayrton. “Look out for yourselves! Defend yourselves!” and he fell back, fainting.</p>
			<p>“Spilett,” said the engineer, “We may be attacked at any minute. Bring the wagon inside the enclosure, and bar the gate, and then come back here.”</p>
			<p>Pencroff, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the orders of the engineer. There was not an instant to be lost. Perhaps the wagon was already in the hands of the convicts!</p>
			<p>In a moment the reporter and his companions had gained the gate of the enclosure, behind which they heard Top growling.</p>
			<p>The engineer, leaving Ayrton for a moment, left the house, and held his gun in readiness to fire. Herbert was beside him. Both scrutinized the outline of the mountain spur overlooking the corral. If the convicts were hidden in that place they could pick off the colonists one after the other.</p>
			<p>Just then the moon appeared in the east above the black curtain of the forest, throwing a flood of light over the interior of the corral, and bringing into relief the trees, the little watercourse, and the grassy carpet. Towards the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade shone white; opposite it, towards the gate, the fence was in shadow.</p>
			<p>A black mass soon showed itself. It was the wagon entering within the circle of light, and Smith could hear the sound of the gate closing and being solidly barricaded by his companions.</p>
			<p>But at that moment Top, by a violent effort, broke his fastening, and, barking furiously, rushed to the extremity of the corral to the right of the house.</p>
			<p>“Look out, my friends, be ready!” cried Smith.</p>
			<p>The colonists waited, with their guns at the shoulder. Top continued to bark, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered sharp cries.</p>
			<p>The colonists, following him, came to the border of the little brook, overshadowed by large trees.</p>
			<p>And there, in the full moonlight, what did they see?</p>
			<p>Five corpses lay extended upon the bank!</p>
			<p>They were the bodies of the convicts, who, four months before, had landed upon Lincoln Island.</p>
